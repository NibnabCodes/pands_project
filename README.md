# Iris Dataset Project 2025

## Investigating the Iris dataset with Python

Author: Niamh Hogan

This repository contains an investigation into the iris dataset as part of the assessment for the Programming and Scripting module at Atlantic Technological University - Galway.

The purpose of this project is to investigate the iris dataset using the Python programming language.

## 2. Iris Dataset Summary

The iris dataset is a multivariate dataset whicha comprises 150 instances from three classes/species of the iris flower (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with 50 instances per class. There are four continuous data features for each sample: Sepal lenght, sepal width, petal length and petal width, measured in centimeters.

In 1936 The iris dataset was introduced by Ronald Fisher in his paper *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems* to exhibit how statistics could be utilized for classification. Fisher argued that based 
on significant feature differences between the Iris species in the dataset, group species membership could be determined by sepal and petal measurements. Based on a combination of the four measurements, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. It was further postulated that the species of a new iris flower could be determined based on the statisical information observed in the dataset.

The Iris dataset remains a foundational example as an introduction to data analysis, machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition given it's following attributes ([Brownlee, 2016](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)):

* The dataset is both complete and balanced, containing no missing values and an equal number of samples for each class.
* All four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width are recorded in consistent units (centimeters), ensuring uniformity in measurement. 
* Notably, Setosa is linearly separable from the other two species, making it easily distinguishable. Although versicolor and virginica exhibit some overlap, they remain largely distinguishable through specific feature combinations. This structure contributes to a relatively straightforward classification task and highlights the dataset’s strong predictive potential.
